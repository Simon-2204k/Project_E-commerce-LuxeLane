**Project Summary:**  
Luxelane is a comprehensive and fully functional e-commerce platform designed to provide users with an engaging and seamless online shopping experience. The platform enables users to browse an extensive range of products, filter them by categories, search for specific items, and access detailed product information including descriptions, pricing, and ratings. Users can conveniently manage their cart and wishlist, with all data persisted locally using localStorage to ensure a smooth and reliable experience across sessions. The project is built using modern web technologies, including **React** for building dynamic user interfaces,**Redux Toolkit** with **redux-thunk** for efficient state management, **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and visually appealing styling, and **React Router DOM** for seamless navigation across pages. Product data is dynamically fetched from the **Fake Store API**, ensuring real-time display of items and enhancing the realism of the shopping experience. Additionally, interactive **GSAP animations** are integrated to elevate the user interface, providing smooth transitions and engaging visual effects that improve overall user engagement. The outcome of this project is a professional-grade, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce website that demonstrates the practical application of modern frontend development techniques, state management, API integration, and interactive animations, making it both an educational and functional platform.
